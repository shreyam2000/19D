<b>Palenque</b>, also anciently known as <b>Lakamha</b> (meaning”Big Water”), was a Maya city state in southern Mexico that flourished in the 7th century.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Mayan civilization showed some unique skills in building temples and pyramids.</b> They also showed a complex writing system and deep astronomical knowledge.
</p>
<p>
The big mystery surrounding this fascinating (and, in some aways, advanced) civilization revolves its disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Their cities had collapsed before the arrival of the invading conquistadores. Palenque, in the state of Chiapas in southern <i>Mexico</i>, is just one of many mysterious monuments left behind
