What can scream <i>“mystery”</i> more than giant 80-ton stone heads on a completely treeless island in the middle of the <b>Pacific Ocean</b>, amid currents that would have made said island really hard to stumble across?
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In our top of mysterious monuments,<b> Easter Island (or Rapa Nui)</b> is the one place we could not leave left out!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is believed that the inhabitants of the site originally arrived from Polynesia. The Easter Island is famous for its giant heads, that are called <i>moai</i>. They were built from the island’s stone quarries and were moved to their current positions.
</p> 
<p style="text-align:justify">
<b>There are no certainties here too, but moai are believed to represent tribal ancestors and they were all tipped on their faces during conflict among the tribes.</b> They were likely moved using techniques incorporating tree logs, but – and this is part of the mystery –  the island was treeless by the time European explorers arrived. The problem of having to deal with the lost of these resources may have been in the origin of the conflicts in this region.
