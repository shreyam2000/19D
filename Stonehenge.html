<h1> Stonehenge </h1><br />
<p>
One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon. The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986.
Surrounded by several hundred burial mounds and located far from the source of its megalithic stones,<b>Stonehenge<b/> is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most mysterious monuments in the world.
</p>
<p>
The earth and ditch around the monument dates to 3100 BC, and while there is some disagreement on the precise date of the erection of the stones, that followed roughly between 2500 BC to 2200 BC.

<p>
But, what makes this historical construction so mysterious? There no certainties regarding the purpose of this site.<b>The most consensual opinion is that this construction might has had multiple uses over the years, all of them cult related.<b/> It’s considered a spiritual and sacred place for worship with a connection to astronomy. Some believe that it was a sort of healing place, based on the conditions of the bodies buried around it. A bit creepy, yes, but also fascinating.
