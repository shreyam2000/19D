<b>The Great Pyramids are likely the most recognizable monument in this list.</b> The Egyptian pyramids are part of our imaginary since we’re children. Their popularity is, in big part, due the Hollywood movies that we grew up with and that were a huge box office success , like <i>“The Mummy”.</i> 
</p>
<p> 
The writer Agatha Christie, the queen of mystery herself, also played a great role in the association of the Egypt with mystery.
</p>
<p>
Who would have imagined that these <b>stone structures</b>, half-buried in the advancing sands of the desert, would inspire so many stories involving <b>curses, treasure hunters and mummies?</b>
</p>
<p> 
While this mysterious monument dates and methods have become clearer over time, there are still so many unanswered questions. There are so many things about the Ancient Egyptian Culture that we still don’t know.
