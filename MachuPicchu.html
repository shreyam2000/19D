This famously photogenic city in the clouds of the Andes was built by the Incas in the 15th century for one of their emperors, <i>Pachacuti</i>. To visit this site, you have to go high – 2,430 metres above sea level.

Machu Picchu remained hidden even from the invading Spaniards and it wasn’t “discovered” until 1911.

The site is famous for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views.<b> Its exact former use remains a mystery</b>.

The best ways to visit it are to ride the train from Cusco to the switchback road or to take an amazing multi-day hike along the Inca Trail.
