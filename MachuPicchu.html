<p>
This famously photogenic city in the clouds of the Andes was built by the Incas in the 15th century for one of their emperors, Pachacuti. To visit this site, you have to go high – 2,430 metres above sea level.

<b>
Machu Picchu remained hidden even from the invading Spaniards and it wasn’t “discovered” until 1911.
</b> 
<p>
The site is famous for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
</p>
<p>
The best ways to visit it are to ride the train from Cusco to the switchback road or to take an amazing multi-day hike along the Inca Trail.
